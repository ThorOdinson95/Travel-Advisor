# Travel-Advisor
This project involves creating a machine learning-based travel recommendation system to address challenges travelers face in choosing destinations that match their interests, budgets, and trip durations. A dataset is designed to represent various destinations with attributes like budget ranges, trip types (e.g., leisure or business), and durations. Using pre-processing techniques, irrelevant columns are dropped, and features are encoded numerically. A Random Forest Classifier is chosen for its accuracy, robustness, and ability to handle categorical data. The model is trained on 80% of the data, with the remaining 20% reserved for testing. Performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics. Future enhancements include adding real-time data, user feedback loops, NLP for text input, and mobile app integration
